To-do items:

-[x] add humidity (qt instead of qv) contours to the Paluch diagram

-[] add tracing of the important points in the curve (mid-point of a layer)

-[] add budget term (vectors) during a discrete chunk of time (dt)

-[] identify and separate stages during the evolution of the curve

-[x] check inversion cloudiness (cloud fraction is an available output.) and confirmed that there is stratiform cloud in BB2017.
