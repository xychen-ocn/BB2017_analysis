#BB2017_analysis

To-do items:

-[x] color-code the MSE-Svl curve by height

-[x] add humidity (qt instead of qv) contours to the Paluch diagram

-[x] add tracing of the important points in the curve (mid-point of a layer)
     - two different views: (trace the same absolute vertical level --> consistent with the budget term

-[x] add budget term (vectors) during a discrete chunk of time (dt)

-[x?] identify and separate stages during the evolution of the curve
     - Yes, there are roughly three stages mentioned in the paper for the control case
     - the key hours are 0-8 hours (no aggregation), 8-36 (aggregation with different rate of growth; 
       exponentially growing linear instability & nonlinear instability), >36 (aggregation stops and even reduced a bit)

-[x] check inversion cloudiness (cloud fraction is an available output.) and confirmed that there is stratiform cloud in BB2017.
